## Chatbot Project

This [Chatbot](https://github.com/mgould1799/chatbot-proj) project showcases a quick project on
Angular, Python Flask, and PostGreSQL DB. The idea is
the frontend takes in a message, sends it to the Flask API,
the API stores it in the database, and finally posts it in Slack.
The frontend keeps a record of the past messages.
I hosted this using AWS for a short period of time, using S3, elasticbeanstalk, and RDMS.

## Blackbaud Capstone Project

For my senior capstone project, I partnered with
Blackbaud labs to create a Twitch chatbot.
The chatbot went off every x amount of minutes within
the streaming channel. A [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meib3fikdrI)
was filmed on more details of the project.

## VPN

I used [AlgoVPN](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo) to create a VPN
within Digital Ocean.

## DNS Server

To create a DNS Server, I utilized a rassberrypi and PiHole.
